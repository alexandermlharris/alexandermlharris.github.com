This page contains links to handy tools which I've grown used to over time. Most are free to download and most I have installed or with me at all times at work.

## Text Editing
- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - My go-to text editor of choice when good old `notepad.exe` isn't up to the job. I particularly like the simple to use but powerful search / search & replace options.
- [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) - A clean and simple side-by-side editor for authoring and previewing Markdown syntax text files. Usually have [PanDoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) nearby too, for converting markdown into other formats, such as MediaWiki for the company wiki etc.

## Development
- [P4Merge](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce_visual_merge_and_diff_tools) - My go-to visual diff/merge tool. In my opinion the best looking merge tool I've used, for me it makes even 3 way merges look clear.
- [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/) - Great general purpose diff tool. I usually use this for the [folder diff](http://manual.winmerge.org/Quick_start.html#d0e618) features, which is great for deploying local files to a web server or similar tasks.

## Source control
- [Tortoise SVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/) - The easiest to use Window's shell SVN client I've found.
- [AnkhSVN](http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net) - Visual Studio SVN plugin which pulls SVN into the IDE.
- [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) - A nice, modern visual GIT client, which integrates with your github account making basic git tasks easy.

## SQL
- [Redgate SQL Compare](http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-compare/) - A simply brilliant tool for comparing MS-SQL database schemas and deploying changes. Costly, but worth it's weight in gold at times.

## Productivity / Ease of use
- [Slickrun](http://www.bayden.com/slickrun/) - Quickly launch apps / websites etc. by typing "magic words" into this lightweight prompt. Brilliant for pre-Vista machines with no searchable start menu and more configurable.
